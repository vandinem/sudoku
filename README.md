# sudoku
Various of my sudoku solver scripts collected in one place

The .txt files are just text representations of unsolved Sudoku boards.  A board consists of 81 characters, every 9 representing the next row of the board.  A blank space (' ') or a zero ('0') is a placeholder for an unfilled cell.
So the file named '2012-06-12 Boston Globe.txt' is just this line:
090107080050306020007000600023040710700000004045030860009000200010608040060209070
Which represents this board:
090 | 107 | 080
050 | 306 | 020
007 | 000 | 600
---------------
023 | 040 | 710
700 | 000 | 004
045 | 030 | 860
---------------
009 | 000 | 200
010 | 608 | 040
060 | 209 | 070
